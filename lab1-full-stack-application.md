“Hi, I’m \[Your Name], and I come from a background in customer service and quality control, where I developed strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Right now, I’m completing a software engineering training program, which has sharpened my ability to learn fast, work in teams, and think analytically. While it’s a technical field, the core skills translate well to a role like this one — where understanding people, solving problems, and staying goal-oriented are key. I’m excited about this opportunity at Hiraya Consulting because I’m ready to grow, contribute, and succeed in a team-driven, performance-based environment.”

##### **How is your software training relevant to this sales role?”**

##### 

“The training isn’t directly related to sales, but it’s taught me to learn quickly, solve problems, and collaborate in a fast-paced team setting — all of which are important in this role. It also shows that I’m coachable, motivated, and not afraid to take on challenges.”





###### **In the Interview (when asked about strengths or what sets you apart)**:



I’ve worked as a server on weekends for over a year now, and I think that’s really shaped my customer service skills. I’m always smiling, and I know how to stay calm and positive even when things get busy. That experience taught me how to connect with people, listen well, and turn stressful moments into good ones — which I think translates really well into sales.
